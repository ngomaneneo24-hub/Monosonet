# 🚀 **Sonet Live Deployment - Complete Guide**

## 🎯 **Overview**

This guide provides the complete roadmap for deploying the Sonet founder moderation system to live production. The system is designed to rival Twitter with enterprise-grade security, complete founder anonymity, and professional moderation capabilities.

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **Core Components**
- **Founder System**: Complete anonymity with moderation privileges
- **Moderation Service**: C++/gRPC backend for high performance
- **API Gateway**: Go-based REST API with security middleware
- **Database**: postgresql with advanced moderation schemas
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx with SSL termination and security headers
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
- **Backup**: Automated daily backups with retention

### **Security Features**
- **IP Whitelisting**: Founder access restricted to specific IPs
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection against abuse
- **SSL/TLS**: Production-grade encryption
- **Firewall**: UFW with fail2ban protection
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, XSS protection
- **Audit Logging**: Complete action tracking

## 🚀 **Complete Deployment Process**

### **Phase 1: Production Setup**

#### **Step 1: Server Preparation**
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install essential tools
sudo apt install -y curl wget git htop ufw fail2ban

# Configure SSH security
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Set: PermitRootLogin no, PasswordAuthentication no
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

#### **Step 2: Run Production Setup**
```bash
# Clone Sonet repository
git clone https://github.com/sonet/sonet.git
cd sonet

# Make setup script executable
chmod +x scripts/setup-production.sh

# Run production setup (as root)
sudo ./scripts/setup-production.sh
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Installs Docker, Docker Compose, and system dependencies
- ✅ Creates production directory structure
- ✅ Configures firewall, fail2ban, and security
- ✅ Generates SSL certificates
- ✅ Sets up systemd services
- ✅ Configures monitoring and backup systems

#### **Step 3: Deploy Services**
```bash
# Start Sonet services
sudo systemctl start sonet.service

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status sonet.service

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u sonet.service -f
```

### **Phase 2: Live Deployment Configuration**

#### **Step 1: Configure Domain and SSL**
```bash
# Set your domain
export DOMAIN="your-domain.com"

# Run live deployment configuration
sudo ./scripts/configure-live-deployment.sh
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Installs Certbot for Let's Encrypt
- ✅ Generates SSL certificates for your domain
- ✅ Configures SSL auto-renewal
- ✅ Updates Nginx configuration
- ✅ Creates DNS configuration guide
- ✅ Sets up production monitoring and alerting

#### **Step 2: Update DNS Records**
Follow the DNS configuration guide created at `/opt/sonet/docs/dns-configuration.md`:

**Required DNS Records:**
- **A Record**: `your-domain.com` → Your server IP
- **A Record**: `www.your-domain.com` → Your server IP
- **CNAME**: `api.your-domain.com` → `your-domain.com`

**DNS Providers:**
- **Cloudflare**: Enable SSL/TLS "Full (strict)" and "Always Use HTTPS"
- **AWS Route 53**: Create hosted zone and A records
- **Google Domains**: Add A records pointing to server IP

#### **Step 3: Wait for DNS Propagation**
- DNS changes typically take 24-48 hours to propagate globally
- Monitor with: `nslookup your-domain.com`
- Test SSL: `openssl s_client -connect your-domain.com:443`

### **Phase 3: Go-Live Verification**

#### **Step 1: Run Go-Live Script**
```bash
# Set domain environment variable
export DOMAIN="your-domain.com"

# Run comprehensive go-live verification
sudo ./scripts/go-live.sh
```

**What this verifies:**
- ✅ All services healthy and responding
- ✅ SSL certificates valid and working
- ✅ Security measures active and tested
- ✅ Performance within acceptable limits
- ✅ Monitoring systems operational
- ✅ Backup and recovery systems ready
- ✅ Founder functionality tested

#### **Step 2: Review Go-Live Report**
The script creates a comprehensive report at `/opt/sonet/docs/go-live-report-*.md` with:
- System status and health metrics
- Security verification results
- Performance benchmarks
- Monitoring system status
- Next steps for production

## 🔒 **Security Verification**

### **Pre-Go-Live Security Checklist**
- [ ] Firewall (UFW) active and configured
- [ ] Fail2ban running and blocking suspicious activity
- [ ] SSL certificates valid and secure
- [ ] Security headers present (HSTS, CSP, XSS protection)
- [ ] Rate limiting active on API endpoints
- [ ] Founder IP whitelist configured
- [ ] Non-root user for application
- [ ] File permissions restricted
- [ ] Log monitoring enabled

### **Security Testing Commands**
```bash
# Check firewall status
sudo ufw status

# Check fail2ban status
sudo systemctl status fail2ban

# Verify SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect your-domain.com:443 -servername your-domain.com

# Test security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..20}; do curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -o /dev/null "https://your-domain.com/api/v1/health"; done
```

## 📊 **Monitoring Setup**

### **Access Monitoring Dashboards**
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090 (metrics collection)
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin) (visualization)
- **Kibana**: http://localhost:5601 (log analysis)
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080 (internal access)

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**
- **Service Health**: API response times, error rates
- **System Resources**: CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Security Events**: Failed login attempts, suspicious activity
- **Business Metrics**: Moderation actions, user activity
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput

### **Alerting Rules**
The system includes pre-configured alerts for:
- High error rates (>5% for 2 minutes)
- Service downtime (>1 minute)
- High response times (>500ms for 5 minutes)
- Resource usage (>80% CPU/memory/disk)
- SSL certificate expiration (<30 days)

## 🔄 **Backup & Recovery**

### **Automated Backups**
```bash
# Backup runs daily at 2 AM
sudo systemctl status sonet-backup.timer

# Manual backup
sudo systemctl start sonet-backup.service

# Verify backup integrity
/opt/sonet/scripts/verify-backup.sh
```

### **Disaster Recovery**
```bash
# Run disaster recovery script
/opt/sonet/scripts/disaster-recovery.sh

# This will:
# 1. List available backups

# Check logs
sudo docker logs sonet_notegres_prod

# Test connection
sudo docker exec -it sonet_notegres_prod psql -U sonet_app -d sonet_production
```

#### **Performance Issues**
```bash
# Check resource usage
htop
df -h
free -h

# Test API performance
/opt/sonet/scripts/performance-test.sh

# Check monitoring dashboards
# Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
# Grafana: http://localhost:3000
```

### **Emergency Procedures**

#### **Service Outage**
1. Check service status: `systemctl status sonet.service`
2. Review logs: `journalctl -u sonet.service -f`
3. Check monitoring dashboards
4. Restart services if needed: `systemctl restart sonet.service`
5. Escalate if unresolved

#### **Security Incident**
1. Block suspicious IPs immediately
2. Review access logs
3. Check for unauthorized access
4. Verify founder account security
5. Notify stakeholders

#### **Performance Issues**
1. Check resource usage
2. Review database performance
3. Analyze API response times
4. Scale resources if needed
5. Optimize queries and caching

## 📈 **Scaling & Optimization**

### **Performance Tuning**
```bash
# Database optimization
sudo docker exec -it sonet_notegres_prod psql -U sonet_app -d sonet_production -c "ANALYZE;"

# Check slow queries
sudo docker exec -it sonet_notegres_prod psql -U sonet_app -d sonet_production -c "SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_time DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Redis optimization
sudo docker exec sonet_redis_prod redis-cli CONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```

### **Scaling Considerations**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more API gateway instances
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas, connection pooling
- **Caching**: Redis optimization, CDN integration
- **Load Balancing**: HAProxy, Nginx upstream scaling
